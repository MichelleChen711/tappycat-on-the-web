					<h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
					 <p>This is a game featuring Tappy, a cat who just wants some love. Your goal is to find sweet spots to keep the happy meter filled. Tappy will let direct you towards the sweet spots but be careful, random tapping will make the happy meter decrease faster.
					 Don't make Tappy wait too long! The longer the "petting session", the more impatient Tappy gets(the meter decreases faster). Tap on Tappy to begin the game! </p>
